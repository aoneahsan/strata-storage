### Common Issues

#### Storage not persisting on iOS/Android
```typescript
// Make sure you're using the right storage type
await storage.set('key', value, {
  storage: 'preferences' // Use native storage
});
```

#### Encryption not working
```typescript
// Ensure you provide a password
await storage.set('key', value, {
  encrypt: true,
  encryptionPassword: 'your-password'
});
```

#### Cross-tab sync not working
```typescript
// Enable sync in configuration
const storage = new Strata({
  sync: {
    enabled: true,
    broadcastChannel: 'my-app-sync'
  }
});
```

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable verbose logging**:
```typescript
const storage = new Strata({
  debug: true
});
```

2. **Check storage availability**:
```typescript
const available = await storage.isAvailable('indexedDB');
console.log('IndexedDB available:', available);
```

3. **Verify storage size**:
```typescript
const size = await storage.size();
console.log('Storage size:', size);
```
